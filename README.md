JattertPy
=========

"Jatten" is a dutch word for stealing, this script is build for my grandmother. She wanted music of a website which simply won't allow me to download it from the webpage itself, so this script is build to get all the mp3's with a google search query that finds all the xml files from that specific website.

Library's used:

-lxml
-google search

and django for the urlquote because there was some problem with unicode in url.
